# Multi-Intent-Classifier

The given dataset contains large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. 
The types of toxicity are:
        •	toxic
        •	severe_toxic
        •	obscene
        •	threat
        •	insult
        •	identity_hate.
The goal of this project is to create a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.
